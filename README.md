# Android Hosts File
A hosts file to block ads on popular apps such as Pandora, Spotify, etc.

So far after using this hosts file I have had 0 ads in Spotify. Before I was
using multiple hosts sources but none of them seemed to have the right
URLs to fully block Spotify ads.

To use this hosts file, you will need to root your device and install
[AdAway](https://adaway.org/)
from the
[F-Droid repository](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway).

The address you should use for the hosts file in AdAway / other Ad blockers is:

Other hosts files I use and recommend:

- [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
This hosts file combines many of the other hosts files I also use but I just
let AdAway merge them all together and remove all the duplicates. I would rather
shotgun the ads away.
- [The AdAway default hosts file](https://adaway.org/hosts.txt)
AdAway includes this by default. It doesn't hurt to use it too.
- [winhelp2002 hosts file](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm)
Another solid hosts file.
- [http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/)
Dan Pollock maintains this hosts file and it is incredibly useful to have.

Block malware as well - why not?
- [http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/](http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/)
Included by default in AdAway

This could be useful for finding more sources to add.

You can find a really good list on
[AdAway's GitHub wiki](https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/wiki/HostsSources)
too.
